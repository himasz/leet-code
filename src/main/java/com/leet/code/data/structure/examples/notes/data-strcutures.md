`TreeMap:`

- `TreeMap` is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the `NavigableMap` interface.
- It is a sorted map that uses a Red-Black tree structure for efficient key-value storage.
- The keys are stored in a sorted order, allowing operations such as range queries.
- Operations like `put`, `get`, and `remove` have a time complexity of O(log n), making it efficient for large datasets.

`Example:`

```java
import java.util.TreeMap;

TreeMap<Integer, String> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
treeMap.put(3, "Three");
treeMap.put(1, "One");
treeMap.put(2, "Two");
System.out.println(treeMap);  // Output: {1=One, 2=Two, 3=Three}
```

`TreeSet:`

- `TreeSet` is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the `NavigableSet` interface.
- It is a sorted set that uses a Red-Black tree structure for efficient storage of unique elements.
- The elements are stored in a sorted order.
- Operations like `add`, `remove`, and `contains` have a time complexity of O(log n), making it efficient for large datasets.

`Example:`

```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

TreeSet<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
treeSet.add("Java");
treeSet.add("is");
treeSet.add("sorted");
System.out.println(treeSet);  // Output: [Java, is, sorted]
```

`PriorityQueue:`

- `PriorityQueue` is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements a priority heap.
- It is a queue in which elements are ordered based on their natural ordering or according to a specified comparator.
- The element with the highest priority is served before others.
- Operations like `offer`, `poll`, and `peek` have a time complexity of O(log n).

`Example:`

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

PriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();
priorityQueue.offer(3);
priorityQueue.offer(1);
priorityQueue.offer(2);
System.out.println(priorityQueue.poll());  // Output: 1
```

`Deque:`

- `Deque` stands for "double-ended queue" and is a part of the Java Collections Framework.
- It allows elements to be added or removed from both ends.
- Implementations of `Deque` include `ArrayDeque` and `LinkedList`.
- Useful for implementing a queue, stack, or other data structures where elements need to be added or removed from both ends.

`Example:`

```java
import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Deque;

Deque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
deque.addFirst("First");
deque.addLast("Last");
System.out.println(deque.pollFirst());  // Output: First
```

These data structures provide different ways to store and organize elements, each with its own strengths and use cases. The choice of which to use depends on the specific requirements of your application.
